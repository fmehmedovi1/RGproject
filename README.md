# Image recognition and 3d modeling of New Synagogue Berlin

The New Synagogue (German: Neue Synagoge) on Oranienburger Stra√üe in Berlin was built in the mid-19th century as the main place of worship for the Jewish community in Berlin, succeeding the Old Synagogue, which
the community had outgrown. Due to its eastern Moorish style and similarity to the Alhambra, the New Synagogue is an important architectural monument in Germany. The goal of the project is to master the Blender tool and work with the Unity platform.
